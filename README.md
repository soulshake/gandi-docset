gandi-docset: Gandi API documentation docset for Dash
============
Gandi has an API that allows users and resellers to fully control all aspects of domains and hosting at Gandi.
The docs are online here: http://doc.rpc.gandi.net/
but sometimes it's great to have offiline access.

Instant offline access to [Gandi API](http://doc.rpc.gandi.net/) documentation with 
[Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash "Dash â€“ Snippet Manager, Documentation Browser"), an API Documentation Browser and Code Snippet Manager.
